# 👋 Hi, I’m Ahmed Ashraf

I’m a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience designing and delivering scalable front-end systems. I’ve worked extensively with React, Angular, and TypeScript, with hands-on experience in frontend architecture, performance optimization, and large-scale application design.

I focus on building systems that are easy to evolve, maintain, and reason about. I enjoy taking ownership, driving technical decisions, and mentoring other engineers while collaborating closely with product and design partners.<a href="https://aashrafh.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">↗</a> 

Outside of work, I enjoy chess ♟️ and anime 🎌.
